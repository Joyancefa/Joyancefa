### Hi there 👋

I am a **self-taught**  👩🏿 Front-End developer living in :fr: and trying my best to contribute more to the tech community :blush:. 

- 🌱 I love understanding how things work and why they are the way they are. 

- 🥅 In 2021, I want to create more educational content through my blog [FrontendJoy](https://frontendjoy.com/).

- 🔭 I occasionally build products like [Sookind](https://sookind-landing-page.web.app/).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love just **staring at nice UI design**: I go on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) and keep browsing, dreaming of the day I could build nice design too 😅.
